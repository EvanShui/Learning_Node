# Node and Chrome are built off of Chrome's V8 Javascript engine. The engine
itself is built off of C++ which allows node and chrome to interact with OS
features (file I/O / file systems / web servers (networks / sockets / etc.)).
Originally JS as a language was quite limited in it's capabilities. This
required developers to work with other langauges to ultimately create a web
app. 

Node.js was developed to bring Javascript to server-side applications. Thus,
Node can be used to access OS, file system, etc. making it an important tool to
build fully-functional applications. Node is written in C, C++, and JS and is
built on top of V8.
